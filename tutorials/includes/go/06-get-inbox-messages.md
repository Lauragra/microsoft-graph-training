## Code explained

Consider the code in the `GetInbox` function.

### Accessing well-known mail folders

The function uses the `userClient.Me().MailFolders.ByMailFolderId("inbox").Messages()` request builder, which builds a request to the [List messages](/graph/api/user-list-messages) API. Because it includes the `ByMailFolderId("inbox")` request builder, the API will only return messages in the requested mail folder. In this case, because the inbox is a default, well-known folder inside a user's mailbox, it's accessible via its well-known name. Non-default folders are accessed the same way, by replacing the well-known name with the mail folder's ID property. For details on the available well-known folder names, see [mailFolder resource type](/graph/api/resources/mailfolder).

### Accessing a collection

Unlike the `GetUser` function from the previous section, which returns a single object, this method returns a collection of messages. Most APIs in Microsoft Graph that return a collection do not return all available results in a single response. Instead, they use [paging](/graph/paging) to return a portion of the results while providing a method for clients to request the next "page".

#### Default page sizes

APIs that use paging implement a default page size. For messages, the default value is 10. Clients can request more (or less) by using the [$top](/graph/query-parameters#top-parameter) query parameter. In `GetInbox`, this is accomplished with the `Top` property in the query parameters.

> [!NOTE]
> The value passed in `Top` is an upper-bound, not an explicit number. The API returns a number of messages *up to* the specified value.

#### Getting subsequent pages

If there are more results available on the server, collection responses include an `@odata.nextLink` property with an API URL to access the next page. The Go SDK exposes this as the `GetOdataNextLink` method on collection page objects. If this method returns non-nil, there are more results available.

### Sorting collections

The function uses the `OrderBy` property in the query parameters to request results sorted by the time the message is received (`receivedDateTime` property). It includes the `DESC` keyword so that messages received more recently are listed first. This adds the [$orderby query parameter](/graph/query-parameters#orderby-parameter) to the API call.
