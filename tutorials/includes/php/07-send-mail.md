    [!INCLUDE [dev-tenant-send-mail](../shared/dev-tenant-send-mail.md)]

1. To verify the message was received, choose option 2 to list your inbox.

## Code explained

Consider the code in the `sendMail` function.

### Sending mail

The function uses the `$userClient->me()->sendMail()` request builder, which builds a request to the [Send mail](/graph/api/user-sendmail) API. The request builder takes a request body that contains the message to send.

### Creating objects

Unlike the previous calls to Microsoft Graph that only read data, this call creates data. To do this with the client library you create an associative array representing the data, set the desired properties, then send it in the API call. Because the call is sending data, the `POST` method is used instead of `GET`.
