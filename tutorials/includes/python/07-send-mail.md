1. To verify the message was received, choose option 2 to list your inbox.

## Code explained

Consider the code in the `send_mail` function.

### Sending mail

The function uses the `user_client.me.send_mail` request builder, which builds a request to the [Send mail](/graph/api/user-sendmail) API.

### Creating objects

Unlike the previous calls to Microsoft Graph that only read data, this call creates data. To do this with the client library you create a dictionary representing the request payload, set the desired properties, then send it in the API call. Because the call is sending data, the `post` method is used instead of `get`.
